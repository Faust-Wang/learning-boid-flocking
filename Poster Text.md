#Text For Poster

**Guidelines: **

By the poster session, you should have finished implementation, run a good chunk of your experiments, and done some basic error analysis. In the poster, you should describe the motivation, problem definition, challenges, approaches, results, and analysis. The goal of the poster is to convey the important high-level ideas and give intuition rather than be a super-detailed specification of everything you did (but you should still be precise). 

You will be evaluated on both the contents of the poster as well as your presentation. You will be assigned to either Session A (9-10:30 AM) or Session B (10:30-12 AM). You should stand by your poster during your assigned slot. During the poster session, the course staff will come around. You should be able to give a 30-second elevator pitch providing the highlights of your work, but also be prepared to take questions about any of the specific details. Additional tips:
1. Use lots of diagrams and concrete examples. Use bullets for the key points, and make sure you use a large font that can be read from a distance. Don't write long sentences and lots of complex equations.
2. Organize your poster into sections, so it's clear what the components of the project are. This also makes it easy to delve into a particular component.
3. Practice and polish your 30-second pitch. Someone should be able to understand what you're doing and importantly, **why**, from listening to it.
4. If you can make a live demo, you should do it!
5. The posterboards are 20" x 30" (not that big!). You can print your poster at Meyer library or Kinkos. Or, for a super convenient/cheap option, you can use blockposters, which splits up your poster into small pages which can be printed on a normal printer.
6. At the beginning of the poster session, you should check in with your mentor, who will provide easels and stands in exchange for a group member's student ID card. You should setup your poster around the mentor's designated area.
All group members are expected to be at the poster session. If you cannot make it, coordinate with your mentor.
**In all cases, submit your poster as a PDF using the submit script by 11 PM that evening.**
